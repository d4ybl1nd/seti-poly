There are couple of variant of this seti themes and i can't recall which one is which. There are few changes made on syntax hightlight but didn't keep the track. 
This theme has been imported to vscode thoroughly for personal use and yet i have no intention to put this theme on vscode marketplace. 

Just in case if you stumble onto this repo and find it liking, there is the icon themes that i would recommand to use.
